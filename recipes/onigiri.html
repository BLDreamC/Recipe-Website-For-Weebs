           <ol><strong>Ingredients</strong>
                <ul>Kelp</ul>
                <ul>Water</ul>
                <ul>Rice Wine Vinegar</ul>
                <ul>Soy Sauce</ul>
                <ul>Mirin</ul>
                <ul>Sake</ul>
                <ul>Seasame Seeds</ul>
                <ul>Sour Pickled Japanese Plums</ul>
                <ul>Rice</ul>
                <ul>Sugar</ul>
                <ul>Salt</ul>
                <ul>Seaweed</ul>
              </ol> 
        <ol><strong>Steps</strong>
            <li>Start by getting the sour pickled Japanese plums and mash them up, remove the pits of the pulm before doing so.</li>
            <li>Wash and clean the rice of the starch before placing into a rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is ready spread the rice in any container or sheet pan and drizzle 2 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp of salt. Then mix.</li>
            <li>To form the Onigiri, start by wetting your hands so the rice won't stick to them. Then get a good portion of rice, shaping the rice into a disc as big as the size of a hockey puck.</li>
            <li>Place the filling, the sour pickled plums (or for Brock's Jelly Douchnut version put jam), into the center and fold the sides into a triangle.</li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
